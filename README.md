# Star War 
Star War is a fun multiplayer action game. Every time you level up, your character will evolve and your weapons and skills will also improve. You can level up by gathering energy by killing other players or eating mushrooms. In this game, it doesn't matter how big your opponent is, but how quickly you can get their weapons. But remember, the larger the opponent, the larger their attack range, so pay attention when approaching them. But the larger the opponent, the slower the speed will be. So take the opportunity to move on and fight!
